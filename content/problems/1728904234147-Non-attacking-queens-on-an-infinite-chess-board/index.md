A classical problem of Gauss (ca.1850) asks if eight queens can be placed on a
chessboard so that no queen can attack any other. Some experimenting shows that
the answer is positive. Furthermore, it is known that, for every
integer \\(n \ge 4\\), one can place \\(n\\) queens on an \\(n \times n\\) chessboard (with the obvious
meaning) so that no queen can attack any other. This can be stated, using the terms
“rows” and “columns” as for matrices, as:

**Theorem 1**: For every \\(n \ge 4\\) one can place queens on an \\(n \times n\\) chessboard so
that there is a queen in every row and in every column and no queen can attack any
other.

This raises the question of what happens if we allow the chessboard to be infinite.

**Problem**: Can one place infinitely many queens on an infinite chessboard so that there is a queen in every row and in every column and no queen can attack any other? Critically, how would one place the queens?

    The solution is not unique, but there is a simple way to place the queens. Think small, maybe start with 5 by 5, and work your way up.
