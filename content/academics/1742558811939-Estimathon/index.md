We are having a **Jane Street Estimathon** on **Monday the 24th** at **6:00PM** in **LG.08** of **40 George Sq** in collaboration with 180 DC! 

*What is the event?*
For the event you will be placed into teams and each time will have 30 mins to correctly estimate the answer to a given number of questions. For example …’what is the volume of the Earth’s oceans, in cubic miles?’

*Why come?*
This is a brilliant opportunity to work in a team and demonstrate quantitative skills for employers. You may also have fun!
