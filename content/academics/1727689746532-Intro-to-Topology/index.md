*"In preparation for my talk on Thursday, this is a brief introduction to the topic of topology, which aims to formalise and study mathematically the notion of space. We'll try to discuss the basic notions of what a topological space is, give a variety of examples to think about, some of which are very bizarre, and if I have time discuss the notion of homotopy."* - Isky Mathews
