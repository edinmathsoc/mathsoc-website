<!-- Join us for an engaging talk on the revolutionary innovation of tomography, which transformed medical imaging in the 1970s by creating detailed 3D maps of tissues from X-ray data. Learn about the mathematics behind this process, current research aimed at minimizing radiation exposure, and the techniques used to address incomplete measurements, all while participating in a fun audience quiz!  -->
In the 1970’s, a new X-ray based innovation was introduced. Tomography, or slice imaging, revealed the inner structure of a patient point by point as a three-dimensional map of tissues. This opened up a new world for doctors as they could do precise diagnosing based on these "CAT-scans.” Tomography is based on recording X-ray images of the patient along many directions, and then using mathematics in a clever way for combining the information into a 3D image. This talk explains that process in simple terms. An important research topic in modern mathematics is to look for a way to do tomographic imaging with the least possible amount of radiation dose to the patient. Or sometimes to compensate for incomplete measurements caused by restrictions in the imaging arrangement. This is based on a process called regularisation, also illustrated in the talk in an easy-to-understand way. Also: there is a fun quiz revealing natural tomographers among the audience.

We are holding this talk in the **Larch Lecture Theatre** in the **Nucleus** on **November the 7th** from **5:15pm**.
