Join us for an engaging talk on the revolutionary innovation of tomography, which transformed medical imaging in the 1970s by creating detailed 3D maps of tissues from X-ray data. Learn about the mathematics behind this process, current research aimed at minimizing radiation exposure, and the techniques used to address incomplete measurements, all while participating in a fun audience quiz! 

We are holding this talk in the **Larch Lecture Theatre** in the **Nucleus** on **November the 11th** from **5:15pm**.
