*"Join us for an information session about Jane Street's Strategy and Product Internship, followed by networking with food and drink provided!*

*This role offers a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of technology, finance, and business strategy. You'll learn how we tackle challenging problems across departments, support the firm's growth, and gain a holistic perspective of our business. If you've never thought about a career in finance, you're in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you'll fit right in.*

*This session focuses specifically on Strategy and Product. It will not cover Quantitative Trading, Research, Software Engineering or any other role.*

*We hope to see you there!"* - Jane Street
