This is a useful QnA session we have where some of our 4th and 5th years talk about and answer questions to do with their degree!

For the first part, a few different 4th and 5th years will speak about their experiences and give out information that they wish they knew earlier in their degree.

The older students will then split off into separate sections of the Mathshub and answer any questions that you may have about your degree.

And did I mention that we have free pizza as well?! 🍕

If you have any questions about your degree that you think older years might be able to answer, or if you want some lesser known useful information about your degree, or if you just want free pizza then come join us!

This will take place in the Mathshub (5312, JCMB) next Tuesday (16th) at 6pm and will run for 1 or 2 hours.

Can't wait to see you there! 😋
