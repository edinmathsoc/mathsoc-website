Join us on **Tuesday 4th February 2025, 17:00-18:15** at the **Larch Lecture Theatre, Nucleus** for a thrilling talk on math research:

What does a math researcher actually do? In a nutshell we try a bunch of different things and hopefully at least one of them ends up working (spoiler: most of them don’t). In this talk I will use a problem from my own research (of proving an upper bound for a series) to illustrate this process. We will see a wide array of tactics deployed such as: Let me solve a simpler version of this problem first. Can I apply this nice result from the literature? Has someone solved a similar problem? Do my colleagues, my supervisor or ChatGPT have any ideas?
