Come along to our special lecture on **Monday 3rd November, presented by Skarleth! ðŸ“‹**

The topic of the lecture is Benchmarking Classification Techniques for Bankruptcy Prediction.

The Abstract:
By benchmarking Data Envelopment Analysis, Case-Based Reasoning, and Decision Trees, we show that hybrid frameworks significantly outperform single-model approaches. The DEA-CBR hybrid achieved 97% prediction accuracy, offering a robust solution for financial risk evaluation.

The lecture will take place at 5pm on Monday 3rd November in the Elm Lecture Theatre, Nucleus.

We hope to see you there!
