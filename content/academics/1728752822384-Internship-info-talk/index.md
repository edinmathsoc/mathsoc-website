Join us after classes for a talk on internships. We will have a panel of students who have completed internships and can share their experiences. We will also have a representative from the careers service, Matt Vikers, to answer any questions you may have. 

Getting an internship is a great way to gain experience and make contacts in your field. This talk is particularly aimed at students in their second, third or fourth year, but all are welcome.

The talk will be held in the **Elm lecture theatre** at **18:00** on **Wednesday the 16th**. We hope to see you there!
