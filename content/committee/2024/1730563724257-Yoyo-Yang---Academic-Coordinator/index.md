Hello! I’m Yoyo (Yuchang) and I’m in my third year of Mathematics and Statistics. Super excited and honoured to be the academic coordinator this year! In this role, I'll be responsible for organising academic-related events, including the Maths Annual Lecture everyone knows and loves. My goal is to help broaden students' knowledge and enthusiasm for mathematics by introducing them to areas beyond their coursework. If you have any suggestions or fun topics in maths that you're interested in, I’d love to hear them!
