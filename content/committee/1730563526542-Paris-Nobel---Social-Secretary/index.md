Hi I’m Paris, I’m a fourth year Maths student and I’m going to be your Social Sec this year. I’m so excited to be planning MathSoc’s iconic socials, which I hope to see you all at! These socials are a great way to meet more people from your course so stay tuned for updates and be sure to come along!
