Hi, I’m Jasper Zhou, a third-year Mathematics student and the Programme Representative for my cohort. I’m passionate about fostering a collaborative learning environment and ensuring students' voices are heard within the School of Mathematics. I’m always open to connecting with fellow students—feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback about your experience in the program!
