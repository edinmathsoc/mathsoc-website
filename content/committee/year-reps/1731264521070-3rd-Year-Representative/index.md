Hello, my name is Kirsten Oâ€™Donoghue and I am a third-year class representative. I study a pure mathematics degree whilst living in gorgeous Edinburgh. I enjoy my role as class rep and hope I can be a voice for students and work with the department to solve any problems. So if you see me around, come say hi!
