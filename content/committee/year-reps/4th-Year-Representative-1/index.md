Hi everyone! I’m Harry, a 4th-year Mathematics and Statistics student and the Student Representative for Year 4. Besides math, I’m also a professional photographer and a content creator on Xiaohongshu. I’m excited to connect with all of you this year and look forward to bringing you interesting content and support!
