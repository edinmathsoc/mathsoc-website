Hey my name is Omar, and I’m a first-year student in the MMath Applied Mathematics program. I’m excited to be your Program Representative this year for first year students! I’ll be here to listen to any feedback you have about the course, and work with the department to make sure our voices are heard. If you ever have any questions, concerns, or suggestions about the program, please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:s2698667@ed.ac.uk). Looking forward to making this year a great one for all of us!
