Hey guys, my name is Naseem, I am a 4th year MMath student, and I will be the Sports Secretary for MathSoc this year. This means I will be in charge of intramural sports. We currently offer men’s and women’s football and mixed netball, however if there is demand we can expand to other sports! I strongly encourage you all to get involved in intramural sports because they’re great exercise, a way to distract from the pressures of uni work, and lots of fun. If anyone has any questions about intramural sports, don't hesitate to contact my email s2145491@ed.ac.uk and I’ll be happy to answer any queries! See you all in September!
