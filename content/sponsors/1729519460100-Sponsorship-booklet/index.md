## About the society

The Edinburgh University Mathematics Society (MathSoc) cultivates a community of students and faculty united by a shared passion for mathematics. This past academic year, we hosted events for nearly 300 members, with at least two events a week, and are on track to not only increase the membership total, but also host even more events ranging from rigorous academic challenges to engaging socials.  
We organise and fund academic lectures on a wide range of topics ranging from pure maths to cutting-edge applied maths and computer science. The community revolves around our dedicated common space for students to socialize, which includes two fully equipped study areas.

## Sponsorship packages

Our society provides sponsors with various opportunities to get involved, ranging from contributing simple raffle prizes to becoming event sponsors.

### Partner Sponsor

As a Partner Sponsor, we will act as an avenue to share any job and internship postings as well as events that you wish to advertise. These adverts will reach an audience of people interested in mathematics ranging from our members to Instagram followers consisting of over 1500 people. All logos will appear prominently on our website and in communications to our network of students, through emails and social media. In addition, we will offer to organise an event specifically catered to your company – for example, we are running an Estimathon for Jane Street where they have provided prizes for the winners. In return, we request a £500 sponsorship fee.

### Gift Sponsor

A Gift Sponsor offers to donate a prize for our various raffles, held twice annually for different charities, thus helping us make a meaningful contribution towards these. We organize two major raffles throughout the year: one during our Christmas Dinner, which hosts up to 65 members, and another at our Maths Ball, attracting up to 250 attendees. By contributing prizes for these raffles, you help encourage our members to make small donations towards worthwhile causes. Your support not only enhances the excitement of these events but also significantly contributes to our fundraising efforts.

### Venue Sponsor

A Venue Sponsor provides MathSoc with access to their space at a discounted rate, offering us valuable support for a range of events. This partnership can range from small committee gatherings or casual socials such as pub quizzes to larger-scale events such as our annual Maths Ball. By sponsoring our venue, you help us ensure that our events are held in suitable and well-equipped locations, while also receiving prominent recognition and appreciation for your contribution.
