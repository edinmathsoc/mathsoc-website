We are a student-run society that aims to bring together students from all years and courses who share an interest in mathematics. We organise a variety of events throughout the year, including socials, academic talks, intramural sports, and careers events. We also take care of the Mathshub, a common room for maths students to study, socialise, and relax.
<!-- Join us for a cup of tea and a free pastry on a Tuesday morning! -->
