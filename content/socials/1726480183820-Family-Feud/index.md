MathSoc presents Family Feud!

We will be holding our second social of the year on Thursday, 19th of September at Bar 50 at 8pm!

Based on hit gameshow, two teams face head-to-head guessing how 100 people of the public answer certain questions. The team with the most points win! Teams will consist of 4-6 members each, and we will have many teams playing!

Before you attend please sign up through this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcR0PJ18--NzSikRQ9U1A6cSqMlhJO8NQbSM_d9ONJVB1BxA/viewform)! You can request teammates through the sign-up link, but don’t worry if you come alone as we’ve got a plan for our teams!!
