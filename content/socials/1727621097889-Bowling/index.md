Join us for a fun night of bowling at **Tenpin, Fountain Park**. We will meet at **8pm** and play a few games. The cost is **£5** per person (£6.50 for non-members) for which you will get 2 games. Please RSVP using the link below as there are limited spaces available.

You will be organised into an academic family team on the night so don't worry if you don't have a team.

**We currently have run out of spaces on EUSA but fear not! We are getting more lanes so please sign up on the form below.**
