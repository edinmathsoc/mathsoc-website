We have secured a consistent training time and venue for the rest of the season. Training will be held on the new MUGA pitches at Peffermill every Monday from 17:00-18:00. The pitches are right by the car park, just go straight on and wonder round the pitches to the entrance. If you have any friends who are keen to join, please bring them along!

We are always happy for new team members to join us, so if you are interested in playing netball, please come along to training or join our WhatsApp group for more information.

Training will cost Â£2 per session, which will go towards the cost of hiring the pitch. I will collect this at the end of the semester.
