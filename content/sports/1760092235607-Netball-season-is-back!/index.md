# We're so back!!

We've made it into the 2025/2026 season and Mathsoc netball is officially up and running again!

We run a mixed netball team, so everyone is welcome! You do not have to have any prior netball experience at all.

We train every thursday at Perfermill, from 4-5pm.

If this sounds like fun to you then joining our whatsapp group will be the number 1 priority for you! Simply message our instagram (@edinmathsoc) and we'll send you a link to join the gc.
