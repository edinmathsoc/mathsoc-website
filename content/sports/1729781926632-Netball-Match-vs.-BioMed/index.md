**This match has been cancelled and will be rescheduled!!**

Our third match of the season is coming up on the **27th of October**. We will be playing against the BioMed' Netball team. They are a very quick team so we will have to bring our running shoes. The match will be at 12:00 on **pitch 1 at Peffermill**. Please can everyone **arrive at 11:40** so we can warm up and have a quick catch up before the game.
