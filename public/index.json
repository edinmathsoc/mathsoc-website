Some experimenting shows that the answer is positive. Furthermore, it is known that, for every integer \\(n \\ge 4\\), one can place \\(n\\) queens on an \\(n \\times n\\) chessboard (with the obvious meaning) so that no queen can attack any other. This can be stated, using the terms ‚Äúrows‚Äù and ‚Äúcolumns‚Äù as for matrices, as:\nTheorem 1: For every \\(n \\ge 4\\) one can place queens on an \\(n \\times n\\) chessboard so that there is a queen in every row and in every column and no queen can attack any other.\nThis raises the question of what happens if we allow the chessboard to be infinite.\nProblem: Can one place infinitely many queens on an infinite chessboard so that there is a queen in every row and in every column and no queen can attack any other? Critically, how would one place the queens?\nSubmit your solution Solution will be available on 21st October 2024. Citations will be added with the solution so as to not spoil the problem.\nHint The solution is not unique, but there is a simple way to place the queens.
